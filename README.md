***Outside comfort zone!

Summary

This project is going to be a systemic trading system, coded in the c# language. I am still learning how to go about planning 
this project out, what tools I will need, and where I will go to find information. 

Once complete, this code will be able to take incoming data from different financial markets, apply rules for buying, selling, 
filters, and position sizing. I will then use the code in tandem with backtesting and strategy performance software which is
available for purchase.
